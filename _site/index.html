<p class="p4">ACCOMPLISHMENTS</p>

<p class="p5">Production Support Lead, Esurance, San Francisco, CA (online auto insurance) 11/2005 - present</p>
<p>Esurance is an innovative online auto insurance company with a short release cycle that follows a rigorous change management process. My role is to provide technical design review, develop monitoring and support processes, identify issues (and sometimes root cause), find workarounds, and lead a team of three that supports the business applications in production. My areas of responsibility and expertise include:</p>

<p class="p7"><br></p>

<p class="p6">Management</p>
<ul>
<li>Effectively managing a team of three, using an approach of listening, clarifying goals, providing autonomy and coaching when needed.</li>
<li>Generate monthly reports of my department (about 12 pages) for the CIO, with statistics, analysis and status.</li>
<li>Lead team effort to reduce average number of tickets opened each business day from more than 240 in 2007 to less than 60 in 2011 (75% reduction), and average number of tickets closed at the end of each business day from 330 in 2007 to 24 in 2011 (93% reduction). This was accomplished while head count was reduced by more than 50%.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p7"><br></p>

<p class="p6">Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Created visualization of the ten most important batch jobs running in production, showing dependencies, and performance on typical and high volume days. These visualizations are used by management, development and production support team.</li>
<li>Developed spreadsheet of more than 100 scheduled batch jobs, filterable by run time and machine, allowing IT to identify windows to plan deployments with minimal or no interruption to production environment, increasing flexibility of patch and project deployments.</li>
<li>Read stack traces to develop understanding of an issue.</li>
<li>Did analysis of Production Support requests, creating tiers of “trainability” to leverage resources in other departments (Help Desk and NOCC).</li>
<li>Did “root cause” analysis of Production Support requests, allowing us to find and prioritize solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p7"><br></p>

<p class="p6">Application Support</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting over 30 different daily batch jobs running in production.</li>
<li>Developed, completed and documented approach in one day for monitoring a Windows service that copies files from the data center to a field office for printing and mailing. At the time, the conventional wisdom was there was no way to do this. Trained Production Support team on the solution.</li>
<li>Developed technique and trained Data Quality team on how to perform data cleanup for document-related defects to provide timely support to the business, reducing risk of non-compliance and improving customer retention.</li>
<li>Initiated support of issues on Android and iOS apps.</li>
<li>Designed and built work flow application for work-at-home call center staff, reducing staffing and facilities costs. Included logical and physical database design.</li>
<li>Initiated support for email marketing campaigns, allowing developers to focus on new features, and providing Marketing and Finance with more responsive support. Included troubleshooting issues, setting up monitoring systems, and responding to ad hoc requests from marketing.</li>
<li>Resolved customer issues by researching web activity using session tables and Tealeaf.</li>
<li>Worked with third party vendors like Bank of America, Chase Paymentech and LexisNexis to resolve production issues and help roll out new products.</li>
<li>Served as lead on Tealeaf for customer experience investigation / verification, training others how to use the application.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p7"><br></p>

<p class="p6">SQL</p>
<p>Have developed SQL skills into my “Swiss army knife”, used for the following problem types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated alerts to identify production issues, returning method name and error, or machine name if the issue is machine specific.</li>
<li>A script to return all emails sent to a customer in html format. Also returned is a customized file name with meta data about the email including email address, date sent, status, and email template name.</li>
<li>Given a policy that appear to be impacted by an as-yet-to-be determined defect, find a larger set of policies that are also exhibiting the same issue.</li>
<li>Measure batch job performance to predict time frame for processing a much larger data set. This was more challenging than it sounds, as the application was not logging items processed.</li>
<li>Measure performance of multi-threaded application, down to each thread.</li>
<li>SQL script whose output is another SQL script to be used for data correction.</li>
<li>Team statistics and current performance goals to make sure we achieve our SLA.</li>
<li>Predict when a currently running batch job will finish, based on the latest hour’s processing rates.</li>
<li>Determine whether or not errors are browser based or state product based.</li>
<li>Find session tracking data for fraud investigations, based on email address, cookie, various personal information (encrypted and clear text), and shared IP address, searching up to 11 years of data.</li>
<li>Created query script that if the database connection was lost, the query could be rerun and the script would pick up where it left off.</li>
<li>Overlay of session tracking URL's and session errors logged.</li>
<li>Defect impact analysis.</li>
<li>Defect data cleanup, from 1,000 to 1,000,000 rows updated.</li>
<li>Daily automated reports.</li>
<li>Queries to be used in ASP pages to aid in business and IT reporting, verification, and troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Identify specific users that are having issue or experiencing a defect.</li>
<li>A query whose output is a PowerShell script.</li>
</ul>
